# Comparing Different Investments

Not all investments are created equal! Let's learn how to compare your options like a pro.

## Key Metrics for Comparison

### 1. Return (How Much Money You Make)

**Average Annual Return**
- How much the investment typically gains each year
- Look at 5-10 year averages, not just one good year
- Remember: past performance doesn't guarantee future results

**Example Comparison:**
- Savings account: 0.5% per year
- S&P 500 index fund: ~10% per year (historically)
- Individual growth stock: Could be -20% to +50% per year

### 2. Risk (How Much You Could Lose)

**Volatility**
- How much the investment's value bounces around
- Higher volatility = more risk, but potentially higher rewards
- Measured by how far returns typically swing from the average

**Maximum Drawdown**
- The biggest loss the investment has experienced
- Shows worst-case scenario from peak to valley
- Helps you understand what you're signing up for

### 3. Fees and Costs

**Expense Ratio**
- Annual fee charged by funds (like index funds)
- Expressed as a percentage (0.03% is better than 1.2%)
- Lower fees mean more money stays in your pocket

**Trading Costs**
- Fees to buy/sell individual stocks
- Many brokers now offer commission-free trading
- Still matters for frequent trading

## Different Investment Types Compared

### Savings Accounts
- **Return**: Very low (0.5-2%)
- **Risk**: Almost zero
- **Fees**: Usually none
- **Best for**: Emergency funds, money needed soon

### Government Bonds
- **Return**: Low but steady (2-4%)
- **Risk**: Very low
- **Fees**: Low
- **Best for**: Conservative investors, portfolio balance

### Index Funds
- **Return**: Moderate (8-12% historically)
- **Risk**: Moderate (can lose 20-50% in bad years)
- **Fees**: Very low (0.03-0.2%)
- **Best for**: Long-term wealth building, beginners

### Individual Stocks
- **Return**: Highly variable (-50% to +200%+)
- **Risk**: High (individual companies can fail)
- **Fees**: Low (if commission-free)
- **Best for**: Experienced investors, smaller portion of portfolio

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
- **Return**: Moderate (6-10%)
- **Risk**: Moderate
- **Fees**: Varies
- **Best for**: Diversification, income

## The Risk-Return Relationship

Higher potential returns almost always come with higher risk. This is called the **risk-return trade-off**.

### Conservative Portfolio (Lower Risk, Lower Return)
- 60% Index funds
- 30% Bonds  
- 10% Cash
- **Expected return**: 6-8% per year
- **Maximum likely loss**: 15-25%

### Aggressive Portfolio (Higher Risk, Higher Return)
- 80% Index funds
- 15% Individual stocks
- 5% Cash
- **Expected return**: 9-12% per year
- **Maximum likely loss**: 35-50%

## How to Compare Specific Investments

### Step 1: Define Your Goals
- **Timeline**: When do you need this money?
- **Risk tolerance**: How much loss can you handle?
- **Amount**: How much are you investing?

### Step 2: Research Key Metrics

For **Index Funds**, compare:
- Expense ratio (lower is better)
- Tracking error (how closely it follows its index)
- Fund size (bigger is usually more stable)

For **Individual Stocks**, compare:
- Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
- Revenue growth
- Debt levels
- Market position

### Step 3: Use a Comparison Framework

| Factor | Investment A | Investment B | Winner |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 5-year return | 8.5% | 12.3% | B |
| Risk (volatility) | 15% | 25% | A |
| Fees | 0.05% | 0.75% | A |
| Liquidity | High | High | Tie |
| **Overall** | | | ? |

## Practical Comparison Example

Let's compare two real options:

### Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) vs Individual Apple Stock (AAPL)

**VOO (Index Fund):**
- Tracks 500 largest US companies
- 10% annual return (historically)
- Very low fees (0.03%)
- Moderate risk (diversified)

**AAPL (Apple Stock):**
- Single company
- 15% annual return (last 10 years)
- No ongoing fees
- Higher risk (one company)

**For a beginner**: VOO is probably better because it's diversified and requires less research.

**For someone with experience**: A small position in AAPL (5-10% of portfolio) could complement a larger index fund position.

## Red Flags When Comparing

### Investments to Avoid
- **Guaranteed high returns with no risk** (scams)
- **Complex investments you don't understand**
- **Anything requiring you to recruit friends** (pyramid schemes)
- **Individual stocks making up more than 5-10% of your portfolio**

### Warning Signs
- Pressure to "act now"
- Returns that seem too good to be true
- Lack of clear fee structure
- No regulatory oversight

## Building Your Comparison Skills

### Practice Exercise
1. **Pick three investments** from different categories
2. **Research their 5-year returns, fees, and risk levels**
3. **Decide which fits your goals best**
4. **Explain your reasoning in one paragraph**

This exercise helps you think like an investor, not a gambler.

## Age-Based Investment Comparison

### Teens (You!)
- **Priority**: Learning and long-term growth
- **Best options**: Broad index funds, maybe 5-10% individual stocks
- **Avoid**: Complex investments, anything you can't explain simply

### Young Adults (20s-30s)
- **Priority**: Growth with some risk tolerance
- **Options**: Aggressive index fund portfolios, some individual stocks

### Middle Age (40s-50s)
- **Priority**: Balanced growth and stability
- **Options**: Mixed portfolios with bonds

### Pre-Retirement (60s+)
- **Priority**: Preservation and income
- **Options**: Conservative portfolios with more bonds

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Compare return, risk, and fees for every investment**  
✅ **Higher returns almost always mean higher risk**  
✅ **Index funds beat individual stocks for most people**  
✅ **Your age and goals should guide your choices**  
✅ **If you can't explain it simply, don't invest in it**
