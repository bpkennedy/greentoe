# Research Before You Buy

Never buy an investment without doing your homework first! Here's how to research like a pro.

## Why Research Matters

### The Cost of Not Researching
- You might buy overpriced investments
- You could miss hidden risks
- You won't understand what you own
- You'll make emotional decisions instead of logical ones

### The Benefits of Good Research
- Better investment choices
- More confidence in your decisions  
- Less stress when markets get volatile
- Higher long-term returns

**Bottom line**: An hour of research can save you years of poor performance.

## Where to Find Reliable Information

### Free, High-Quality Sources

**SEC.gov (Securities and Exchange Commission)**
- Official government financial database
- Company filings and reports
- Completely unbiased and factual

**Yahoo Finance / Google Finance**
- Basic company information
- Stock charts and prices
- News and analyst opinions
- Financial statements

**Company Investor Relations Pages**
- Annual reports (10-K forms)
- Quarterly reports (10-Q forms)
- Press releases and earnings calls

**Morningstar.com**
- Mutual fund and ETF analysis
- Independent research and ratings
- Great for index fund research

### What to Avoid
- Random social media "tips"
- Paid newsletters promising guaranteed returns
- Anonymous online forums (for serious decisions)
- Anyone trying to sell you something

## Research Process for Index Funds

Index funds are easier to research than individual stocks. Here's what to check:

### 1. What Does It Track?
- S&P 500? Total stock market? International?
- How many companies are included?
- What sectors/industries are represented?

### 2. Performance History
- How has it performed over 5, 10, 15 years?
- How closely does it track its index?
- How did it perform during market crashes?

### 3. Fees and Expenses
- **Expense ratio**: Lower is always better
- Look for ratios under 0.2% (0.03% is excellent)
- Avoid funds with fees over 1%

### 4. Fund Size and Age
- Larger funds are usually more stable
- Older funds have longer track records
- Very small funds might be risky

### Example: Researching VTSAX
**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund**

✅ **Tracks**: Entire US stock market (3,900+ companies)  
✅ **Performance**: 10.1% annually over 20 years  
✅ **Expense ratio**: 0.04% (excellent)  
✅ **Fund size**: $300+ billion (very stable)  
✅ **Age**: Started 1992 (long track record)  

**Conclusion**: Excellent choice for US stock exposure.

## Research Process for Individual Stocks

Individual stocks require much deeper research:

### 1. Understand the Business
- **What does the company actually do?**
- How do they make money?
- Who are their main customers?
- What are their main products/services?

**Rule**: If you can't explain the business to a friend in 2 minutes, don't invest.

### 2. Financial Health Check

**Revenue Growth**
- Is the company growing sales over time?
- Look for consistent growth, not just one good year

**Profitability**
- Does the company actually make money?
- Are profits growing or shrinking?

**Debt Levels**
- How much debt does the company have?
- Can they easily pay their debts?

**Cash Flow**
- Is the company generating cash?
- Do they have enough cash for emergencies?

### 3. Competitive Position
- What makes this company special?
- Who are their main competitors?
- Is their industry growing or shrinking?
- Do they have any "economic moats" (competitive advantages)?

### 4. Valuation (Is It Fairly Priced?)

**Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)**
- Stock price ÷ earnings per share
- Compare to competitors and historical averages
- Lower might be better value (but not always)

**Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S)**
- Stock price ÷ revenue per share
- Useful for companies with low or no profits

**Rule of thumb**: If a stock seems too expensive compared to similar companies, it probably is.

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Company Red Flags
- Declining revenue for multiple years
- Lots of debt compared to other companies
- Management selling lots of their own stock
- Accounting irregularities or investigations
- Major competitors taking market share

### Research Red Flags
- You can't find basic financial information
- All the news is either amazing or terrible (no balance)
- The company's business model doesn't make sense
- You're investing based on tips, not research
