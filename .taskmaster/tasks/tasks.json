Implement comprehensive error handling and validation\n<info added on 2025-08-02T05:12:03.526Z>\n## Security Implementation Guidelines (Based on 2024 Best Practices)\n\n**Key Management:**\n- Environment variable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be base64-encoded 32-byte key\n- Generate keys using `crypto.randomBytes(32)` for production\n- Implement key rotation policies for enhanced security\n- Never hardcode keys in source code\n\n**IV Generation:**\n- Use `crypto.randomBytes(12)` for each encryption operation\n- Never reuse IV with same key (critical for GCM security)\n- Package IV with ciphertext for transmission\n- IV must be unique but doesn't need to be secret\n\n**Authentication Tag Handling:**\n- Retrieve 16-byte auth tag using `cipher.getAuthTag()`\n- Package as: IV (12 bytes) + Auth Tag (16 bytes) + Encrypted Data\n- Set auth tag with `decipher.setAuthTag()` before decryption\n- Tag verification failure indicates tampering/corruption\n\n**Error Handling Patterns:**\n- Wrap crypto operations in try-catch blocks\n- Return 400 Bad Request for malformed input\n- Return 401 Unauthorized for authentication failures\n- Log errors securely without exposing sensitive data\n- Use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks\n- Implement timeout handling with abort controllers\n\n**Implementation Structure:**\n```\nEncryption: plaintext → IV + cipher.update() + cipher.final() + getAuthTag() → IV+Tag+Ciphertext\nDecryption: IV+Tag+Ciphertext → extract components → setAuthTag() + decipher.update() + decipher.final() → plaintext\n```\n\n**Additional Security Measures:**\n- Use Node.js `KeyObject` API for enhanced key security\n- Validate input sizes before processing (200KB limit)\n- Implement comprehensive roundtrip testing\n- Test edge cases: empty input, max size, corrupted data\n- Regular Node.js LTS updates for security patches\n</info added on 2025-08-02T05:12:03.526Z>",
